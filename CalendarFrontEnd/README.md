## ReadMe

This is a 2018 Calendar app for the Spotify TTP fellowship. The backend is an API built with Ruby on Rails. I chose to use React for the frontend so one could dynamically change months without reloading.

## Features

The calendar shows one event title per day but lists how many others are hidden. By clicking on a day one sees what events there are scheduled for that day. On the right of the calendar the option of adding an event also shows up. By clicking on a specific event one can edit it as well instead of adding a new one.

## Future improvements

I'm still fairly new to React so would like to make better usage of components to make the code more clean.
